### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**KatxCryn/KatxCryn** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing skills for writing code in order to build a project of my own. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to apply my knowledge of programming language to write my own code. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on : anything honestly, I have only had exposure to self motivated learning at home.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with where to begin, and any advice and open to directional notation. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what I am interested in creating, and why.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: through email anakathryn@protonmail.com or sweetkittyxannie@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I am female biologically and prefer she/her or my nickname Kat.
 - âš¡ Fun fact: I am a musician and love literature, I have passion for writing especially poetry and writing my own music as well. I am a pianist, and precussionist. 
--> I use my gritty life experiences to draw strength, for no masterpiece was created overnight. I expect nothing but honesty and respect, and am willing and determined to master the art of software development and cyber security. I have varying interests in developmen, programming, computer language, cryptography, cybersecurity, ect. and DevOps....
